						<h2><a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/">Brac University</a></h2>
						<p>I stated my undergraduation studies in Brac University in January 2018. Brac University is the most reputed private university in Bangladesh and is the third best university in the country.  Moreover, BRAC University has ranked in the QS World University ranking among the 1001-1200 universities globally.It is widely known for it's outstanding School of Data Science and has incredible research oppurtunities which is why I chose to study BSc. in Computer Science and Engineering here.</p>
						<p>I am currently in my 11th semester and expect to graduate in January 2022. For the degree we have to complete 136 credits hours where 4 credit hours for final thesis. So far the couses I enjoyed the most were Artificial Intelligence, Database Systems and Mordern Probability Theory and Stochastic. Hence I have developed an immense interest in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision. I am also passionate about Blockchain technology mainly because of the security it offers hence chose to work with it in my undergraduate thesis.</p>
						<h3>Thesis</h3>
						<p>Currently I am pursuing undergraduate thesis "Recruitment System to Verify and Forecast using Blockchain and Machine Learning" </p>

						<h3>Awards and Scholarships</h3>
						<p>During my first year I was awarded 50% Previous Academic Results based Scholarship from Brac University. 
							During my second year I was eligible to be awarded 75% Merit Based Scholarship and I got it every semester since Spring 2019 as my CGPA was greater than 3.95. These scholarships not only helped me financially but also motivated me do better than before every semester and kept my moral high.</p>
